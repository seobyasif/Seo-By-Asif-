    <h1>What is SEO?</h1>
    <p>
      SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of optimizing your website so that it ranks higher on search engine results pages (SERPs), such as Google. The goal is to increase organic (non-paid) traffic to your website.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is SEO Important?</h2>
    <p>
      When someone searches something on Google, they usually trust and click on the top results. If your website is well-optimized, it can appear on the first page of Google, which significantly increases visibility and potential business growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of SEO</h2>
    <p>There are mainly three types of SEO:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>On-Page SEO:</strong> This involves optimizing content, keywords, title tags, meta descriptions, and internal links within your website.</li>
      <li><strong>Off-Page SEO:</strong> This focuses on building backlinks, social sharing, and online reputation from external sources.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical SEO:</strong> This ensures the website is technically sound - including fast loading speed, mobile responsiveness, secure connection (HTTPS), and clean site architecture.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Learning and implementing SEO takes time, but when done correctly, it can significantly improve your websiteâ€™s visibility and bring in more targeted visitors, leading to more growth and success.
